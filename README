####---Look Here And Read This, Thanks!---####
    
	I'm deploying my servlet on Tomcat's root application. Here is a simple instruction (but need root access):
	1. cd into /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps ;
	2. rename the ROOT folder by
	   $ mv ROOT oldROOT
	3. cd into my solution.
	4. run ant in sudo to deploy in one command (easy!):
	   $ sudo ant tomcat-root
	   
	If this succeeds, you can access my XPathServlet by the URL 'http://localhost:8080/xpath'
	
	Alternatively, you can copy the web archive into tomcat's webapps folder by yourself, but you should run
	   $ ant servlet-war
	first to build the war file. Then you can run:
	   $ sudo cp servlet-war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT.war
	   
	
	BTW, the web.xml under conf/ is ready to deploy on Tomcat.  
	BTW*2, the 'fancytable.css' is the stylesheet I used in my servlet, please don't move it or delete it.
	BTW*3, I didn't try Jetty, but I think it should be easy as the war file are already there.
